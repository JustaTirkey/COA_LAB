### Inference 
*DRAM has least memory access where as LD1 has most memory access.
*Cache misses are more in LD1 than in L2

### Correlation between L1 and L2 and DRAM
It seems like you're asking about the correlation between L1 and L2 cache and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) in computer systems. Let me explain the relationship between these components.

L1 and L2 Cache:
L1 (Level 1) and L2 (Level 2) cache are small, fast memory units that are built into the processor chip itself or very close to it. Their purpose is to store frequently accessed data and instructions in order to reduce the time it takes for the processor to access this data. The main difference between L1 and L2 cache is their size and proximity to the processor. L1 cache is smaller but faster, while L2 cache is larger but slightly slower.

L1 cache is split into two parts: L1 Data Cache and L1 Instruction Cache. L1 Data Cache stores data that the processor is currently working on, while L1 Instruction Cache stores instructions that the processor needs to execute.

L2 cache is a larger cache that stores additional data and instructions that may not fit in the L1 cache. It acts as a buffer between the faster L1 cache and the slower main memory (DRAM).

DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory):
DRAM is the main memory in a computer system. It is a type of volatile memory that stores data that the processor and other components need to access during program execution. Unlike cache memory, which is much faster but smaller, DRAM is slower but provides a much larger storage capacity. When data or instructions are not found in the cache memory, the processor retrieves them from the DRAM.

Correlation between Cache and DRAM:
The relationship between cache memory (L1 and L2) and DRAM is hierarchical and based on the principle of memory hierarchy. Cache memory is much faster to access than DRAM, but it's also more expensive to manufacture. This is why computer systems use a hierarchy of memory to balance speed, capacity, and cost.

When the processor needs data, it first checks the L1 cache. If the data is present in the L1 cache, it's referred to as a cache hit, and the data is quickly accessed. If the data is not in the L1 cache but is in the L2 cache, it's a cache miss at the L1 level but a cache hit at the L2 level. If the data is not found in either the L1 or L2 cache, it's a cache miss, and the processor needs to retrieve the data from the slower DRAM.

In summary, L1 and L2 cache are designed to provide fast access to frequently used data and instructions, while DRAM serves as the main memory where larger amounts of data are stored. The correlation between these components lies in the hierarchy that allows for a trade-off between speed and capacity in computer systems.
